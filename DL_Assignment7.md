# Answers

1. Applications for different types of RNNs:

Sequence-to-sequence RNN: Used in machine translation, chatbots, speech recognition, and any task where the input and output are both variable-length sequences.
Sequence-to-vector RNN: Suitable for sentiment analysis, document classification, and any task where you want to summarize a variable-length input sequence into a fixed-size vector.
Vector-to-sequence RNN: Useful for tasks like image captioning, where you generate a variable-length sequence (caption) from a fixed-size vector (image representation).

2. The inputs to an RNN layer typically have three dimensions:

Batch size: The number of sequences or samples in a batch.
Sequence length: The number of time steps or elements in each sequence.
Input features: The number of features or dimensions in each time step.
The outputs of an RNN layer also have three dimensions, with the addition of the hidden state dimensions, which represent the network's internal state at each time step.

3. In a deep sequence-to-sequence RNN, you should set return_sequences=True for all recurrent layers that are not the final layer to ensure that each layer in the stack generates sequences. In a sequence-to-vector RNN, typically, you only set return_sequences=True for the last RNN layer to get a sequence output.

4. For forecasting the next seven days in a daily univariate time series, you can use a sequence-to-sequence RNN architecture, where the input sequence would consist of past days' data, and the output sequence would contain forecasts for the next seven days.

5. Main difficulties when training RNNs:

Vanishing gradients: RNNs can struggle with long-range dependencies due to vanishing gradients. You can address this with techniques like LSTMs or GRUs.
Exploding gradients: Gradients can also explode during training. Gradient clipping is a common method to handle this.
Memory and computation: RNNs require significant memory and computation, especially for long sequences. Techniques like batching and sequence truncation can help.

6. 1D convolutional layers in an RNN:

Used for feature extraction in time-series data.
Helps capture local patterns and dependencies in the data.
Useful for reducing the sequence length before passing it to an RNN, reducing computation and memory requirements.

7. To classify videos, you can use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from video frames and then pass the features through an RNN or a fully connected neural network to make predictions based on the video sequence.

To train a classification model for the SketchRNN dataset, you can follow these general steps:

Load and preprocess the data from TensorFlow Datasets.
Design a neural network architecture suitable for sequence data, which could include a combination of RNN, LSTM, or convolutional layers.
Train the model using an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
Evaluate the model on a validation set and fine-tune hyperparameters as needed.
Finally, test the model on the test set to assess its performance.
